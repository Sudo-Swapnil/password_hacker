In this stage we use a database containing most common passwords. 
The database contains passwords in lowercase, however, we take into consideration all sorts of casings. 
For e.g: a password of 6 chars will generate 64 different cases (considering all chars and no numbers)
again, here we assume the password may contain combination of only small latin characters (a-z) and any digit (0-9). 

The algorithm is the following:

1. Read a password from the database of most common passwords
2. Using itertools.product() to generate the given password in all sorts of mixed cases
3. On generating each password string, send the password to the server using socket.
4. If generated password is not the user password, we continue generating next case / passward until we guess the password correctly.
5. On getting success message from the server, we print the guessed password and terminate
