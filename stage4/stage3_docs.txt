Along with password, this time we try to hack the login id.

For login id, we use a list of most frequently used admin usernames. 

The database contains usernames in lowercase, however, we take into consideration all sorts of casings. 
For e.g: a username of 6 chars will generate 64 different cases (considering all chars and no numbers)
again, here we assume the username may contain combination of only small latin characters (a-z) and any digit (0-9). 

To hack the password, we use one of the system vulnerability.

We get: 
{
    "result": "Exception happened during login"
}

response from the server, when a character matches the password. Using this, we build the whole password, character by character until we get the response:
{
    "result": "Connection success!"
}

The algorithm is the following:

1. Try all logins with an empty password.
2. When you find the login, try out every possible password of length 1.
3. When an exception occurs, you know that you found the first letter of the password.
4. Use the found login and the found letter to find the second letter of the password.
5. Repeat until you receive the ‘success’ message.
